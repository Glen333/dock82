# Stripe Payment Integration - Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

The payment integration has been updated to properly display the Stripe credit card input fields.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `src/PaymentPage.js`**
   - Added missing `PaymentElement` import from `@stripe/react-stripe-js`
   - This provides the modern Stripe payment form with full credit card fields

### 2. **Updated `src/DockRentalPlatform.js`**
   - Imported `PaymentPage` component
   - Removed old `PaymentComponent` that used deprecated `CardElement`
   - Updated rendering logic to use `PaymentPage` when `showPaymentPage` is true
   - Properly wrapped PaymentPage with Stripe Elements context

### 3. **Updated `src/index.js`**
   - Changed to import and use `DockRentalPlatformWrapper`
   - This ensures the entire app is wrapped in Stripe's `Elements` provider

## How It Works Now

1. When user clicks "Book this slip" and fills out the form
2. On form submission as a "renter", it shows the payment page
3. PaymentPage displays:
   - Full Stripe PaymentElement with credit card fields
   - Card number, expiry, CVC, and postal code inputs
   - Pre-filled billing information
   - Secure Stripe processing

## Environment Setup

Your Stripe keys are configured in `.env.local`:
- `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Test key configured ✅
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Test key configured ✅

## Testing

You can test the payment flow using Stripe test cards:
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Declined: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- Requires 3D Secure: `4000 0027 6000 3184`

Any future date for expiry, any 3-digit CVC, any zip code.

## What You'll See

When you click "Book this slip", you'll now see:
- A professional payment form with multiple card input fields
- All fields properly rendered and functional
- Real-time validation as you type
- Secure Stripe-hosted payment processing
