# Instructions for Claude: Fix Stripe PaymentElement Integration

## Problem
Stripe PaymentElement fails to render with error:
"In order to create a payment element, you must pass a clientSecret or mode when creating the Elements group"

## Current Situation
✅ Backend server works - creates payment intents successfully
✅ clientSecret is generated correctly  
✅ Local API at http://localhost:5001 responding
❌ PaymentElement doesn't render because Elements wrapper doesn't receive clientSecret

## Files to Upload
1. src/DockRentalPlatform.js
2. src/PaymentPage.js  
3. src/index.js
4. server.js

## What to Tell Claude

```
I have a Stripe payment integration issue. The PaymentElement component fails to render with the error: "In order to create a payment element, you must pass a clientSecret or mode when creating the Elements group".

Current setup:
- src/index.js renders DockRentalPlatformWrapper
- DockRentalPlatformWrapper wraps DockRentalPlatform with <Elements stripe={stripePromise}>
- DockRentalPlatform shows PaymentPage when showPaymentPage is true
- PaymentPage successfully creates payment intent and gets clientSecret
- But the clientSecret is never passed back to the Elements wrapper

The issue is in the architecture: 
- Elements wrapper at the root level (DockRentalPlatformWrapper) needs the clientSecret
- But clientSecret is created dynamically inside PaymentPage
- PaymentPage's clientSecret state is never passed up to the Elements wrapper

Please fix this by:
1. Making the Elements wrapper receive the clientSecret dynamically
2. Or restructuring so PaymentElement can work with the current setup
3. Ensure PaymentElement renders properly with credit card input fields

Requirements:
- Keep PaymentPage as a separate component
- clientSecret is created async and available after API call
- Backend is working at http://localhost:5001
- Stripe keys are configured correctly

The goal is to have the Stripe payment form with card number, expiry, CVC, and postal code fields working properly.
```

## Architecture Issue

The problem is architectural mismatch:
```
DockRentalPlatformWrapper
  └─ <Elements stripe={stripePromise}>  ← Needs clientSecret here
      └─ DockRentalPlatform
          └─ PaymentPage  ← Creates clientSecret here (too late)
```

Claude needs to either:
1. Pass clientSecret up from PaymentPage to Elements wrapper
2. Restructure with a separate Elements wrapper for PaymentPage
3. Use a different approach entirely

## Notes for Claude
- PaymentElement must be inside Elements context
- Elements context needs clientSecret OR mode parameter
- Backend successfully creates payment intents (visible in Stripe Dashboard)
- The issue is React state/prop flow, not Stripe configuration
