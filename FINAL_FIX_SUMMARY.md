# Final Fix Summary - Stripe Integration

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Key Mismatch
- ✅ Changed `vercel.json` from `pk_live_...` to `pk_test_51SG5p53...`
- ✅ Both frontend and backend now use matching test keys from the same Stripe account
- ✅ Updated all Stripe key references

### Issue 2: Elements ClientSecret
- ✅ Added `key={clientSecret}` to Elements to force remount when clientSecret changes
- ✅ Wrapped PaymentPage with its own Elements context
- ✅ PaymentElement now properly receives clientSecret

### Issue 3: Double Mounting
- This is normal React StrictMode behavior in development
- Only happens in development, not production

## What to Do Now

1. **Stop the React app** (press Ctrl+C in the terminal running npm start)
2. **Restart the app:** `npm start`
3. **Hard refresh browser:** Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
4. **Test the payment form**

The credit card fields should now appear! The Stripe integration will work properly with matching test keys.
