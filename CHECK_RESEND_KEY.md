# 🔑 Check Your Resend API Key

The server shows: `Resend API Key present: Yes ✅`
But you're getting: `API key is invalid`

This means the key in `.env.local` is either:
1. ❌ **Placeholder text** (`your_resend_api_key_here`)
2. ❌ **Expired** or revoked
3. ❌ **Wrong key** (used testing key instead of real one)

## ✅ **Quick Fix:**

### 1. Verify Your API Key

Open `.env.local` and check if `RESEND_API_KEY` looks like:
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

It should start with `re_` and be a long string.

### 2. If It's Wrong, Get a New One:

1. Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Make sure you're logged in
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Give it a name: "Dock82 Local Dev"
5. Copy the **FULL** key (starts with `re_`)
6. Replace the value in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_full_key_here_no_quotes
   ```

### 3. Restart the Server:

```bash
pkill -f "node server.js"
sleep 2
node server.js > /tmp/server.log 2>&1 &
```

### 4. Test Again:

Try making a booking. You should see:
```
✅ Email sent successfully: [email-id]
```

## 🔍 **Verify It Works:**

Check the logs:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/server.log | grep -i "email sent"
```

## 💡 **For Now:**

The system will gracefully handle the error and still complete the booking. The booking will succeed even if email fails!
