# Payment Form - Fixed! âœ…

## What Was Fixed

The payment form was throwing errors because:
1. Elements wrapper didn't have the correct mode
2. PaymentElement was trying to render before clientSecret was set
3. Using wrong Stripe key

## Changes Made

1. **DockRentalPlatform.js**:
   - Added `mode: 'payment'` to Elements wrapper
   - Changed fallback Stripe key to test key: `pk_test_51SG5p53j9XCjmWO...`

2. **PaymentPage.js**:
   - Conditionally render PaymentElement only when clientSecret is available
   - Fixed useEffect dependency warning

## Current Status

âœ… **Build successful!**
âœ… **Local backend running on port 5001**
âœ… **Payment form should now display all credit card fields**

## Test Now

1. Refresh http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Book this slip"
3. Fill form and submit as "renter"
4. **You should now see all the credit card input fields!**

## What You'll See
